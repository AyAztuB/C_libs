# C_libs

AyAztuB's C Library.
In continuous development

## Introduction

This is a collection of tools for the C programming.

## Compile in static or dynamic library

You can use the global Makefile or a subdirectory Makefile.
The global Makefile allow you to compile all the libraries of a sub-cathegory
(like the DataStructures one). To install a specific library, you need to use
the Makefile in it.
From the global one, just do (with `<LIBRARY>` the library to compile and
`<METHODE>` the static or dynamic methode)
```
make <LIBRARY>_<METHODE>
```
For example, the DataStructures library is compiled as follow:
```
make data_structures_static
make data_structures_dynamic
```
By using the subdirectory Makefile, you just need to precise the methode:
```
make static
make dynamic
```
A main.c program is also provided and you can test the library on it with the
following command.
```
make test
```
To clean all the compilation, just do
```
make clean
```

## Install
On windows, just became better ðŸ¤£ ...

You can also install the dynamic library in your system.
By default, the library will be installed at `/usr/lib/`, the header at
`/usr/include/` and the man page at `/usr/share/man/man3/`
If your systems path aren't the aboves, you can change it at the begining of the
main Makefile

From a sub-directory, you can install the current library by using one of the
above.
```
sudo make
sudo make install
```

To install the libraries from the general Makefile, do
```
sudo make <LIBRARY>_install
```
with `<LIBRARY>` the library to install. For exemple, with the DataStructures
library, it's as follow
```
sudo make data_structures_install
```
If you want to install all of the libraries, you can do
```
sudo make
```

To uninstall a specific library, you can do
```
sudo make uninstall_<LIBRARY>
```
You can uninstall all of the libraries with
```
sudo make uninstall
```

## Use

### Installed Library

```
#include <ayaztub.h>
#include <ayaztub/LIBRARY.h>
```
with `LIBRARY` the name of it (for exemple: `#include <ayaztub/data_structures.h>`
or `#include <ayaztub/data_structures/linked_list.h>`)
To compile your program with it, don't forgot to link with the library:
```
gcc main.c -layaztub
gcc main.c -layaztub_LIBRARY
```
(for exemple `gcc main.c -layaztub_data_structures` or `gcc main.c
-layaztub_data_structures_linked_list`)

### Static library

If you haven't put the library in the `/usr/lib/` path, you will need to move
the library and the header file in your code source directory
you will include it with `#include "linked_list.h"` and compile it with
`gcc main.c -L. -llinked_list -o main`
You also can compile your program like `gcc main.c libLIBRARY.a` (for exemple:
`gcc main.c liblinked_list.a`). So on, you can include it with `<>` instead of
`""`

## Content

For specific documentation, please refer to the README in the subdirectory or
use the given man page (if not installed: `man ./ayaztub.t`)

### Data structures

**Include**
```
#include <ayaztub/data_structures.h>
```
**Library name**
```
libayaztub_data_structures
```
**Compilation**
```
gcc main.c -layaztub_data_structures
```
**MAN page**
```
man ayaztub.data_structures
man ./DataStructures/data_structures.t
```
